                    <h3>2. Design of Overcurrent Relay Using MATLAB Simulink</h3>
                    <p>The Design of Overcurrent Relay Using MATLAB Simulink project focuses on modeling and simulating
                        the behavior of an overcurrent protection relay used in electrical power systems.</p>
                    <p>The project focuses on creating a
                        simulation model for an overcurrent protection relay, essential for safeguarding electrical
                        power systems from faults like short circuits and overloads. Using MATLAB Simulink, both
                        instantaneous and definite time overcurrent relays are designed to monitor current
                        levels and trip the circuit when abnormal conditions are detected. The instantaneous relay
                        operates without delay when the fault current exceeds a set threshold, while the definite time
                        relay incorporates a time delay before tripping. By simulating various fault scenarios and
                        adjusting parameters like pickup current and time delay, the project evaluates the relayâ€™s
                        performance in terms of accuracy and response time, showcasing how Simulink can be used for
                        effective power system protection design.</p>
                    <h3>Key Achievements:</h3>
                    <p>* Designed and simulated instantaneous and definite-time overcurrent relays.</p>
                    <p>* Optimized relay settings to handle various fault conditions effectively.</p>
                    <p> *Achieved accurate protection coordination for electrical systems.</p>

                    <h3>3. Transmission Line Performance Assessment Using Matlab</h3>
                    <p>The Transmission Line Performance Assessment Using MATLAB project involves evaluating the
                        electrical performance of a transmission line by analyzing key parameters such as voltage
                        regulation, efficiency, and power losses</p>
                    <p>The project focuses on evaluating the
                        performance of electrical transmission lines by simulating key factors such as voltage
                        regulation, efficiency, and power losses. Using MATLAB, the project models short, medium,
                        and long transmission lines to analyze their behavior under various load conditions. By
                        incorporating parameters like impedance, admittance, and load angles, the simulation assesses
                        critical aspects such as voltage drops, power flow, and system stability. This project
                        demonstrates how MATLAB can be used to optimize transmission line efficiency and reliability
                        through detailed performance analysis and visualization.</p>
                    <h3>Key Achievements:</h3>
                    <p>* Analyzed transmission line performance under diverse load conditions.</p>
                    <p>* Developed models to assess and improve transmission line efficiency.</p>
                    <p> * Identified key performance metrics and areas for optimization.</p>
